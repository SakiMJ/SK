The shared dependencies between the files we are generating include:

1. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of dependencies and scripts for the Next.js application. All other files indirectly depend on this as it defines the packages that will be used throughout the application.

2. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the configuration for TypeScript. It is used by all TypeScript files (.tsx) in the project.

3. **React**: As Next.js is built on top of React, all .tsx files will share the dependency on React and ReactDOM.

4. **Next.js**: All .tsx and .js files will share the dependency on Next.js for server-side rendering, routing, and other features.

5. **Document and App Components**: The _document.tsx and _app.tsx files are special Next.js files that wrap around all other pages. Therefore, all other .tsx files in the pages directory will share these components.

6. **CSS Styles**: The globals.css file will contain global styles that are applied to all pages in the application. Therefore, all .tsx files in the pages directory will share these styles.

7. **Favicon**: The favicon.ico file in the public directory will be used by all pages in the application.

8. **Server-side rendered files**: The .js files in the .next/server/pages directory are the server-side rendered versions of the corresponding .tsx files in the pages directory. They share the same dependencies as their .tsx counterparts.

9. **Function Names**: If there are any shared functions across multiple files, these function names would be a shared dependency. However, without specific details on the functions used in the application, it's not possible to list them here.

10. **DOM Element IDs**: If there are any shared DOM elements across multiple files, these element IDs would be a shared dependency. However, without specific details on the DOM elements used in the application, it's not possible to list them here.
